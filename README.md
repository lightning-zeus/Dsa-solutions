# Dsa-solutions
Solutions of example and intext questions from The book DSA in C 
This repository holds some of the solutions from the book DSA in C by REEMA THAREJA. 
I created this repository as a place to store the solutions for future reference purposes and also to track the number,kind and type of questions that I have solved from the book.
This is a public repo,so you can refer to the solutions as well, apologies beforehand because I am too lazy to comment the code,so you would need to figure out most of the code yourself.
I will still try to add comments whenever possible.
